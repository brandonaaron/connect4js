The files "c4.c" and "c4.h" provide the functions necessary to implement a
front-end-independent Connect-4 game.  Multiple board sizes are supported.
It is also possible to specify the number of pieces necessary to connect in
a row in order to win.  Therefore one can play Connect-3, Connect-5, etc.
An efficient tree-searching algorithm (making use of alpha-beta cutoff
decisions) has been implemented to insure that the computer plays as
quickly as possible.

The file "game.c" is also being distributed, which illustrates how the
Connect-4 functions can be used to construct an implementation of an actual
game.  This file was quickly written just to get an actual implementation up
and running; it is NOT the reason for this distribution.  The idea is for
people to create their own front-ends for this algorithm.  The functions
have been designed to be general enough to be used with any front-end one
wishes to design.

The documentation describing each function can be found in the source code
itself, "c4.c".  I believe the comments in this file are clear and
explanatory enough not to warrant an external documentation file.  The
sample front-end, "game.c", contains no documentation (hey, I've got other
work to do, you know!).


History
-------

I developed this particular algorithm back in October 1992 for an
Artificial Intelligence assignment.  At the time, I implemented it in LISP.
One year later I decided to convert the algorithm to C code so that I could
use it as the smarts of a graphical front-end to the game.  In performing
the conversion, I took care to make the code as generic as possible.

Version 1.0 (Fall, 1993)
    initial C implementation

Version 2.0 (March, 1995)
    was released when John Tromp (tromp@daisy.uwaterloo.ca) pointed out
    to me that I was only implementing "shallow" alpha-beta cutoffs and
    showed me how to implement "deep" cutoffs.  Thanks, John!

Version 2.1 (October, 1995)
    fixed a bug in the is_winner() function that occurred when the value
    of player was something other than 0 or 1.

Version 3.0 (November, 1995)
    was a complete overhaul.  Most of the guts remained the same, and it
    was just as efficient, but the interface functions changed.

Version 3.1 (May, 1996)
    fine-tuned some of the innards, making the average computer move take
    1/3 of the time it used to.  Minor changes were made to the functional
    interface.

Version 3.2 (June, 1996)
    fine-tuned the innards a bit more, making it a bit more efficient.

Version 3.3 (November, 1996)
    fine-tuned the innards a bit more.  Also, the poll interval is now
    specified in terms of CPU time rather than tree depth.  Thanks to
    Miles Michelson (milesmi@uclink4.berkeley.edu) for making this
    suggestion.

Version 3.4 (April, 1997)
    modified the order in which the game tree is searched, making the
    average computer move take 1/5 of the time it used to.  Thanks to
    William Krick (krick@elvis.rowan.edu) for suggesting this.  Also fixed
    a bug that could be triggered when a board width or height smaller
    than the number of pieces required in a row to win is specified.

Version 3.5 (April, 1998)
    fine-tuned the innards a wee bit more, making it a bit more efficient.
    Thanks to Stefan Bellon (bellonsn@trick.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de)
    for pointing out the appropriate change.

Version 3.6 (April, 1999)
    hard-coded the first move of a standard 7x6 game of Connect-4 to be
    the middle column (proven by Victor Allis in his Master's thesis
    ("ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/victor/connect4.ps") to be the best first
    move).

Version 3.7 (May, 2000)
    rearranged one of the internal data structures, making the average
    computer move take about 80% of the time it used to.  Also added the
    c4_get_version() function.


Legal Stuff, etc.
-----------------

I am releasing these functions to the public domain.  Therefore, people can
use them, copy them, distribute them, modify them, and do whatever they
want with them.

If you find any bugs (gasp!) or have any questions or comments about the
functions or about the algorithm itself, you can contact me via e-mail.  My
address is "pomakis at pobox.com".  I'd be interested in hearing what you think!

Oh, one other thing... I've put a lot of work into these functions, so I'd
appreciate it if you kept my name attached to them when distributing or
modifying them.  If you actually use these functions for anything, give me
credit somewhere!


The Algorithm  (not exactly as implemented, but algorithmically equivalent)
-------------

All array indexes are zero-based.

Global variables:

              x = the board width.

              y = the board height.

              n = the number to connect.

       level[2] = the skill level of the computer players, where applicable.

    board[x][y] = the board, where board[i][j] contains the value:
                        0 if player 0 occupies position i,j
                        1 if player 1 occupies position i,j
                        C4_NONE if neither player occupies position i,j.

              z = the number of possible n-in-a-row areas on the board
                  in which a winning connection can be made.  This equals:
                        4*x*y - 3*x*n - 3*y*n + 3*x + 3*y - 4*n + 2*n*n + 2.

                  Each n-in-a-row area on the board in which a winning
                  connection can be made is given a unique number from 0 to
                  z-1.  Each space on the board is told which n-in-a-row
                  areas it is part of.  This is done with the array...
                  
      map[x][y] = an array in which each element is a list specifying, for
                  each corresponding board space, which n-in-a-row areas
                  it is part of.

    stats[2][z] = an array containing statistics of each player.  Statistics
                  for player 0 are contained in stats[0], while statistics
                  for player 1 are contained in stats[1].  stats[a][b] will
                  contain 0 if the n-in-a-row area b is no longer a
                  winning possibility for player a.  Otherwise it will
                  contain 2^p, where p is the number of pieces player a has
                  in this area.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upper-level Algorithm:

    set up map[][] array
    set every element in board[][] to C4_NONE
    set every element in stats[][] to 1
    set player to either 0 or 1

    while game is not over
        col = get_desired_col(player)
        drop_piece(player, col)

        if is_winner(player) or is_tie()
            game is over
        endif

        player = 1 - player
    endwhile

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

get_desired_col(player):
    if player is human
        return number from user interface
    else
        return best_move(player, level[player])
    endif

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

best_move(player, depth):  /* recursive! */
    minimax search of possible future board states, using alpha-beta
    cutoff techniques to limit unnecessary searches.  Look up these
    techniques in any AI book.  The "goodness" of a board state at any
    point in time, from the point of view of the current player, is equal to
    score(player) - score(1-player), where score(p) = sum of stats[p].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

drop_piece(player, col):
    row = row the token will end up in after falling down the column
    board[col][row] = player
    for each element q in map[col][row]
        stats[player][q] = stats[player][q] * 2
        stats[1-player][q] = 0
    endfor

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

is_winner(player):
    for each element s in stats[player]
        if s = 2^n then return TRUE
    endfor
    return FALSE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

is_tie():
    if no element of board[][] is C4_NONE
        return TRUE
    else
        return FALSE
    endif

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sample map that I show above is just to show what the map[x][y]
array should look like for a 7x6 board of Connect-4 (even though it's
usually filled in dynamically using a few iterative loops).  The numbers
in this array are labels on the winnable n-in-a-row areas of the board.
This is useful so that when a piece is dropped into an arbitrary board
position, the algorithm can determine very quickly which n-in-a-row
areas have become more likely destined for a win for the player, and, as
importantly, which n-in-a-row areas are no longer possibilities for the
opposing player.  The numbers in the map[x][y] array are indexes into a
pair of parallel single-dimensional arrays which keep track of how likely
each n-in-a-row area is to be the winning area for each player.  I call
this the stats array.  The "score" of a player is merely the sum of the
stats array of the player.  Subtracting one score from another determines
how well a player is doing relative to the opposing player.  You throw
these numbers into your general run-of-the-mill minimax algorithm, throw
in some alpha-beta cutoff logic for efficiency, and that, in a nutshell,
is the secret to my algorithm.
